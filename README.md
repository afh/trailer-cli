Command-line Trailer
=======

Copyright (c) 2017 Paul Tsochantaris

Released under the terms of the MIT licence, see the file LICENCE for details.

## What is it?
A version of [Trailer](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/trailer) that runs in macOS & Linux command-line, can integrate into scripts, be used on remote servers, or used because consoles are cool. This version does not aim for feature parity with the mainstream Trailer project.

## Building
Requires Swift 4. This means opening the project in Xcode 9 (latest beta or release) or alternatively a binary can be built with the relevant scripts in the root directory for macOS or Linux.

## Warning: Work In Progress
This source is very much a work-in-progress at the moment. There is no documentation, and you should expect weirdness, force-pushes, code to break, and no release binaries.

This will change quite soon but, for the moment, please do not rely on this code for anything apart from experimenting.
